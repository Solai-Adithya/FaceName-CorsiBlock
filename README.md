# FaceName-CorsiBlock : CS308 Project

## What is this Game About

The Corsi-block tapping task is a standard psychological test for evaluating an individual's visuospatial memory abilities.In the Corsi-block tapping task, the individual has to first observe a pattern of blinking blocks on a computer screen and then try to recall the exact order in which the different blocks blinked. In the face-name associative memory task, the individual is asked to learn the names and affiliations of some faces. The web-based application will be used for collecting data and for building cognitive models to predict human behavior in these tasks.
